# Bootstrap-Portfolio

## Description

I have created a portfolio using bootstrap components and their classes for the media queries, in order to make the page responsive on different screen sizes.
Using bootstrap saves a lot of time in the process of writing code as it comes with prebuilt components and classes. 
It makes it possible for a web page or app to detect the visitor's screen size and orientation and automatically adapt the display accordingly.
This portfolio helped me put in practice all the concepts learned during the course.


Here is a link to my deployed Github page containing the portfolio: [https://meri1211.github.io/bootstrap-portfolio/].
